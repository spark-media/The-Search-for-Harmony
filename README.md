## The Search for Harmony
A web-based game exploring the life of George Bridgetower, and Afro-European violin prodigy.

**_inspired by the documentary film and book by Rita Dove, Sonata Mulattica_**

You can play this beta at http://beta.searchforharmony.org/full-game/

To download and run on your computer, you will need a free tool like [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/) for music to load.

Once installed, you can download these files into 'htdocs' and start MAMP

MAMP will open a start page. Look in the browser URL for something like http://localhost or http://localhost:8888/ and remove everything after the last '/'

The game should then be playable from your browser.

More about the project [here](https://thesearchforharmony.org).
